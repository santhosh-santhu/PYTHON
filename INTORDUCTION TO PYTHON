                                             INTRODUCTION OF PYTHON
    > It was created by Gudio van Rossum, in the year 1991
    > Python is a High Level,interpreted and Object Oriented Programming Language
    
    
                                             WHAT IS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE?
    > A programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer can understands
    > They are divided into 2 types
              1.High Level Programming Language.
              2.Low  Level Programming Language.
              
     1) High Level Programming Language
        .It is a friendly programming language
        .it can easy understand by the programmer
        .it is simple to maintain and debug
        .it needs a complier or interpreter  for translation
        
     2) Low Level Programming Language
        .It is Machine Language (instructions will be in the form of 0's and 1's       
        .It is hard to under stand for a programmer but it can understood by the computer
        .It is complex to debug comparatively.
                                 
         PYTHON>>>> OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
            >> IT IS CALLED AS "INTERPRETED LANGUAGE"
            >> PYTHON DOESNT CONVERT CODE MACHINE CODE TO
            >> IT CONVERT THE PROGRAM CODE TO[BYTE CODE]                     
            >>>> FOR CONVERT BYTE CODE WE NEED AN INTERPRETER TO DO THIS
            >>>> THE INTERPERTER ID "PYTHON VIRTUAL MACHINE"                     
                                 
         >>>PYTHON CODE-->>SYSTEM CHECKER&TRANSLATOR-->>BYTECODE(input)-->> PYTHON VIRTUAL MACHINE-->>OUTPUT                    
                                 
         >> WHAT PYTHON CAN DO
            1) Python can use to create web application
            2) python is used to for a software to create workflows
            3) It can connect to database
            4) It can used for big data and perform complex mathematics
                                 
                                 
          >> WHY PYTHON
            1) It is easily understood 
            2) It has a simple syntax like same as English
            3) It is used for writing a fewer lines of code
            4) Many of libaries and frameworks that use for coding and save time
